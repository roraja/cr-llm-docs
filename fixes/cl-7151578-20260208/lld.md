I'll analyze the CL's diff and existing files to create a detailed Low-Level Design document.

Now let me also look at the existing `lld.md` to understand what needs to be updated, and look at the comments for any review feedback.

Now I have all the information needed. The existing `lld.md` references files not in this CL (clipboard_host_impl.h/.cc) and has some inaccuracies compared to the actual diff. Let me create an accurate, comprehensive LLD based on the actual patch.

Now I have all the details. Let me write the comprehensive LLD document.

Let me verify the file was written correctly by checking key sections.
